<h2>System Diagnosis Engine</h2>

<p>
System Diagnosis Engine is a professional accessibility-focused Windows command-line system inspection and reporting utility created especially for blind and NVDA users. This tool generates structured technical reports covering hardware details, operating system configuration, network status, storage health, performance metrics, and many other diagnostic categories. It uses guided menus, spoken-friendly output, progress announcements, and clean professional feedback messages so users always know what is happening.

The engine is designed for daily troubleshooting, system auditing, accessibility testing, and collecting technical information without requiring advanced computer knowledge. Every operation is fully keyboard driven and works completely offline once downloaded. Reports are generated in organized folders, making it easy to share results with technicians or keep records for future reference.

Special care has been taken to ensure screen reader compatibility, minimal visual clutter, and predictable navigation. No background services run, no telemetry is collected, and no system settings are modified. The tool is portable, lightweight, and suitable for students, accessibility users, administrators, and privacy-focused environments. It is ideal for diagnosing Windows issues, understanding system configuration, and maintaining a healthy computer in a safe and accessible way.
