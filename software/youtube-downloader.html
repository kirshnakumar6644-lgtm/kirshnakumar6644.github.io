<h2>YouTube Downloader</h2>

<p>
YouTube Downloader is an accessibility-first offline command line utility that allows blind users to download audio, video, playlists and full channels directly to their computer. It supports MP3, M4A, WAV and MP4 formats with automatic folder organization for downloaded content.

The menu-driven interface is fully keyboard accessible and optimized for screen readers. Users simply paste a link, choose audio or video, and the tool handles everything automatically. Playlist and channel downloads are supported with structured folder creation, making large downloads easy to manage.

This utility is built on trusted offline engines and does not rely on web browsers or online converters. All processing happens locally on your system. Clear status messages guide users through every step, ensuring a smooth experience even for beginners.

Designed for educational and personal accessibility use, this tool helps visually impaired users save learning content, music, lectures and videos for offline listening or viewing. Users should always respect platform terms and copyright rules when downloading content.

Lightweight, portable and professional, YouTube Downloader is ideal for users who prefer simple command line workflows instead of complex graphical applications.
