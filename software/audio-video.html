<h2>Audio Video Converter</h2>

<p>
Audio Video Converter is a professional accessibility-focused command line utility designed for blind users and keyboard-only workflows. This tool allows you to convert audio files into video using clean background colours or your own image, and also extract audio from video files with a simple guided menu system.

When converting audio to video, users can select from multiple professional background colours including blue, white, black, green, purple, gray and more, or provide a custom image. This makes it ideal for creating simple audio-based videos for learning content, presentations, or uploads.

The converter supports MP3, WAV and MP4 formats and works completely offline using embedded processing engines. Every step is announced through clear text prompts compatible with screen readers like NVDA. No graphical interface is required, making it lightweight, fast, and distraction-free.

This tool is especially helpful for visually impaired creators who want basic media conversion without complex editors. It provides reliable output, professional feedback messages, and safe processing without modifying original files. Designed for daily accessibility needs, educational use, and personal projects.
